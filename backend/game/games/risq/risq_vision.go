Visibility Levels (all âˆˆ this range):
  0: unexplored: nothing visible
  1: not visible: terrain, ownership (no zones)
  2: poor visibility, total resources / buildings / units (no zones)
  3: modest visibility, resources / buildings / units in zones (no stats)
  4: good visibility, full stats of all resources / buildings / units
  5: spies, can see enemy orders

Inequalities:
  space >= edge_adjacent
  edge_adjacent >= adjacent
  adjacent >= edge_opposite
  edge_opposite >= secondary
